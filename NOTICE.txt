Descriptions:
 
 Hello, Everybody! My name is Stefanos Stavrianos and I make a program in Python, 
 which can find derivative (or partial derivative) of a function. Before using the 
 program you have to install the latest version of Python.
 Also, you have to write in your terminal:

 > pip install sympy
